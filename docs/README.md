# 欢迎来到模拟殖民地Wiki!
模拟殖民地是一个交互式建筑模组，可让你在Minecraft中创建自己的繁荣城镇。它通过提供一切你需要的工具，让你的领导技能得以发挥。模拟殖民地提供了灵活性，让你创建一个与其他玩家独一无二的殖民地。有了如此多的选择，你每次都会打造一个不同的殖民地，适应任何生态区域，建在山内、山顶、海底，或是天空中。  
唯一的限制就是你的想象力！

模拟殖民地拥有NPC工人，例如 [建筑工](Workers/builder), [Farmers], [渔夫], [护林员], [矿工], [Smelters], [Bakers], [Cooks], C[ouriers], 五种牧民, [Composters]等等，随着模组的发展，更多内容正在开发和添加。  
It also includes specialized buildings such as the [Warehouse], [Residence], [市政厅](Buildings/townhall), [Barracks], [图书馆], [大学], and even the School.

MineColonies is a free and open-source mod developed by Let's Dev Together (LDT), a non-profit community. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ldtteam/minecolonies). Our developers are a hard-working, well-integrated coding team, continuously adding more content to make the MineColonies experience even greater.
